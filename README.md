# CustomCrypt
A program allowing you to create custom multilayered encryptions by stacking together different algorithms including popular algorithms and custom algorithums specific to this program. You can also create your own algorithm by creating an equation that will modify the unicode code of a character. These equations will have variables %k1-n% for however many keys you supply, %i1%, %i2%, %i3%, %i4%, and %i%, for the import (%i1% is the first char, %i2% is the second, etc). Finally, it will have $t, which gives the current char it is on as the index of the input string +1, and finally, $pi, which follows the same rules for $i except it gives the output of the previous character.
