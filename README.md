# CustomCrypt
A program allowing you to create custom multilayered encryptions by stacking together different algorithms including popular algorithms, as well as custom algorithms specific to this program. You can also create your own algorithm with an expression that will modify the character code of the inputted text. These expressions have variables %k1-n% for however many keys you supply, and %i% for the input. It also has %t%, which gives the amont of characters encrypted+1. The algorithms implemented are AES, 3DES, Blowfish, as well as my custom algorithms, BDS and BAS, which are both based upon P-Cipher. This program also has the feature to save and load the encryption stack as an encrypted file (encrypted with AES).

CustomCrypt used the following libraries: exp4j, JSON-java. The full names for these libraries can be found in the lib folder, which contains placeholder (empty) libraries.
